### Command Activation Turn Order

During the Action Phase each player takes turns activating in-command cadres. The player that won initiative that turn goes first. Each time a player activates, if he/she has more than N times the number of in-command cadres as all other players, heshe activates up to floor(N) cadres before the next player goes.

After all in-command cadres are activated, then out-of-command cadres may be activated. Apply the same rules as above, but now only for out-of-command cadres.

If a cadre is out-of-command and needs to appoint a new leader, this is done at the start of that cadre's next activation. Similarly, cadres that become out-of-command due to EW Jamming typically regain command at the start of their next activation.

### Unarmored Unit Hit Boxes
All unarmored units (infantry, guns, and others) can have up to 3 hit boxes. Failing a save removes a hit box.

Infantry Squad         - 3 hit boxes
Inf Weapon Team        - 2 hit boxes
Small/Specialist Team  - 1 hit box
Small Gun              - 2 hit boxes
Large Gun              - 3 hit boxes
Small Vehicle (e.g. Jeep Sized)  - 2 hit boxes
Large Vehicle (e.g. Truck Sized) - 3 hit boxes

Infantry teams have Action Points equal to the number of hit boxes remaining.

### Infantry and Light Vehicle Firepower Tests

Infantry and Gun teams that are hit make saves as in vanilla HGS.

Light vehicles however roll against the firepower of the attacking weapon, or 9+, whichever is worse for the defender.

Alternative Rule: Light vehicles make firepower tests like regular vehicles, but skip the armor check due to not having armor.

### Armor Conversion from Heavy Gear Blitz
As a rough rule of thumb, multiply AR by 8/6 to get Front Armor. For some units (e.g. heavy tanks) this may not give a high enough value, so multiply more, potentially up to 2x.

### Fragile/Sturdy
Units without Fragile or Sturdy have a -1 to all rolls when they have 2 hitboxes remaining, and a -2 when they have 1 hitbox remaining

Units with Sturdy have a -1 when they have 1 hitbox remaining.

Units with Fragile have a -1 when they have 4 or less hitboxes remaing, a -2 when they have 2 hitboxes remaining, and a -4 when they have 1 hitbox remaining.

An important exception to all of the above is that undamaged units do not suffer penalties due to the number of hitboxes remaining.
